# SnakePy

Fun little project that I'll use as a quick reminder of basic python features.
I will write this app with WinOS CMD in mind so for things like "frame rerender" 
Im going to use CMD commands if necessary (mainly "cls" to not make too much mess in the
output.

Im not going to use any python game engine libraries like PyGame so I expect having to work with threads
to split I/O operations between them (such as capturing user input and outputting/rendering scenes 
consistently).

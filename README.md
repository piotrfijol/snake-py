# SnakePy

Fun little project that I'll use as a quick reminder of basic python features.
I will write this app with WinOS CMD in mind so for things like "frame rerender" 
Im going to use CMD commands if necessary (mainly "cls" to not make too much mess in the
output.

Im not going to use any python game engine libraries like PyGame so I expect having to work with threads
to split I/O operations between them (such as capturing user input and outputting/rendering scenes 
consistently).

Also, Im disabling AI suggestions in VSCode that produce random snippets of code at times. I understand it can be useful
when time is of the essence and you treat is as "upgraded autofill" but for my use case it's more irritating than
it is helpful + it wouldn't be much of a "refresher" if AI would've written the whole thing for me :)
